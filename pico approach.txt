This might be feasible on a pi pico w
we would need to rely heavily on the PIO to intake the full streams
probably have one processor dedicated to doing the audio mixing and output via i2s
one processor dedicated to web interface/setting mixer values.

https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/pio/clocked_input/clocked_input.c

we will likely need both PIOs, one on each of the 8 channel streams
many DMAs to shove the dataframes into memory, handing off to each other 

get current mix levels from another dma, do math and shove out i2s to audio amplifier board.


https://github.com/elehobica/pico_spdif_rx << allready done the hard PIO in work. includes spdif to i2s.
